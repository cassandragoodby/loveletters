	<p><span class="pinkword">Uploading</span> to you saves me. Having so many versions in one place gives me the ability to always change knowing you will always be there for me. You have saved my projects and my grades many times. I don't know what I would do without you.<br><br>Github is a web based GIT/version control repository. It allows you to collaborate with individuals and to have the safety of previous versions that you can resort back to. It is accessed through the terminal using git commands and logging into github.com.</p>
